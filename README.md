# wax-rplanet-alert
This is a python script that periodically sends a request to a WAX blockchain endpoint (node) for a certain contract (Rplanet game). 
When a certain event is found in the response, an function is fired that sends an email (using your own gmail for example) to selected 
email address with certain content of the even.
